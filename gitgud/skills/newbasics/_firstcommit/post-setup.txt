Now that we've initialized a repo, we're going to take the Git Gud training wheels off and let you focus on git.

Here are the most important commands that you should commit to memory:
    git gud goal
    git gud status
    git gud explain
    git gud test
    git gud load

Remember them, and they'll guide you through the levels. If you ever forget what they do, run "git gud <command> --help" for a refresher.
If you ever get stuck and forget which commands to use (or if you want to see some new commands), just run "git gud" or "git gud help" again.
Good luck!
