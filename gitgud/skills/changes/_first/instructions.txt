Now that you have a repo, you're going to want to start using it.
>>>
As stated before, repos are used to keep track of your changes.
Your changes a stored in what's known as a commit.
>>>
Commits are called "commits" because you use them to "commit" your changes.
>>>
You can think of committing your changes as another way to save your files, just a little more advanced.
Among other things, you need to manually add your files to commits, and each commit comes with a message.
>>>
Commits are also ordered, so there is naturally a first commit. Most people call this their "Initial commit".
>>>
Making your first commit will look something like this:

Create a file, it can be named anything, and it can have anything in it.
Type "git add myfile.txt" to add your file (in this case, the name of the file is "myfile.txt")
Type "git commit -m "Initial commit""
>>>

Make your first commit, and then we can get started





Normally, you'll use commits to save your changes, 

The first thing you need to know about repos is that they contain commits. In this level, you'll make a commit
>>>
So what do commits do?
Commits store your changes. Every time you make changes and "commit" them, you're saving your changes.
